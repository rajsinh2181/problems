A stringstream associates a string object with a stream allowing you to read from the string as if it were a stream (like cin).
To use stringstream, we need to include sstream header file. The stringstream class is extremely useful in parsing input. 

Basic methods are:

clear()- To clear the stream.
str()- To get and set string object whose content is present in the stream. 
operator <<- Add a string to the stringstream object. 
operator >>- Read something from the stringstream object.

example

void printFrequency(string st)
{
    // Each word it mapped to
    // it's frequency
    map<string, int>FW;
   
    // Used for breaking words
    stringstream ss(st);
   
    // To store individual words
    string Word;
 
    while (ss >> Word)
        FW[Word]++;
 
    map<string, int>::iterator m;
    for (m = FW.begin(); m != FW.end(); m++)
        cout << m->first << "-> "
             << m->second << "\n";
}
 
// Driver code
int main()
{
    string s = "Geeks For Geeks Ide";
    printFrequency(s);
    return 0;
}

output:
For-> 1
Geeks-> 2
Ide-> 1
